# Optimizing Route for Single-Source Ridesharing Services

The idea of this project was to replicate the method that the Northeastern Red-eye services implement in daily rides.<br/>
The Single-Source Ride Sharing Service was created with the idea of allocating seats to passengers that would result in a minimum cost, maximum capacity and the best route. The idea is to use algorithms to optimize the route for a single source ride-sharing service. By applying shortest path algorithms, the optimal time to travel to the destination for each individual passenger is achieved.

Dataset (for passenger data):<br/>
Dummy dataset created to mimic passenger data with parameters - 
* Passenger ID (does not repeat in a single timeframe booking)
* Booking Timestamp (to determine the booking was made)
* Dropoff Location (randomly decided location ID, does not include Pickup Location)
* Number of Denials (number of times passenger turned down by the system)
