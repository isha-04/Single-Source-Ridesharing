# Single-Source-Ridesharing
Optimizing route for a single source ride sharing service

The idea of this project was to replicate the method that the Northeastern Red-eye services implement in daily rides.<br/>
The Single-Source Ride Sharing Service was created with the idea of allocating seats to passengers that would result in a minimum cost, maximum capacity and the best route. The idea is to use algorithms to optimize the route for a single source ride-sharing service. By applying shortest path algorithms, the optimal time to travel to the destination for each individual passenger is achieved.
